Console Application to copy files from a local folder to S3 buckets

If you started to work with AWS services and need to transfer your local files to S3 buckets in a solution that has many and large directories with thousands or millions files, this console application can be useful to you. 

I wrote an article that I showed a simple solution based in a recursive function [Using C# Parallel to copy files to S3](http://aragostinho.github.io/2015/03/11/using-c-parallel-to-copy-files-to-s3.html).
